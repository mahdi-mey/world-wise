# React Travel Tracker

This is a React application that I built to learn how to implement `react-router-dom` and the `Context API`. Users can track the places they have visited using the application.

## Features
- Add new places with details such as name, location, and date visited
- View a list of all the places visited
- Edit or delete existing entries
- Easily navigate between different views using React Router

## Technologies Used
